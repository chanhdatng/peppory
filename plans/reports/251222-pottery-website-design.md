# Pottery/Ceramic Shop Website Design Trends 2024-2025

## 1. Common Page Layouts for Artisan Pottery Shops

**Grid & Masonry Layouts**
- Product showcase via clean grid (2-4 columns) with masonry options for varied dimensions

- Dark palettes (muted greys, blacks) with accent colors to let products shine

**Recommended Structure**
- Hero section: Featured product(s) with compelling imagery
- About/Story section: Artisan background & craftsmanship narrative
- Product gallery: Grid or masonry with lightbox integration
- Portfolio/Process: Behind-the-scenes creation documentation
- Contact/Order: Simple CTAs for custom requests

## 3. Color Palettes (Earthy Tones Focus)

**Primary Palette**
- **Warm Neutrals:** Terracotta (#C9634F), Sand (#D4B896), Warm Cream (#F5E6D3)
- **Greens:** Sage Green (#7A9E7A), Olive (#6B8E23) - strong 2025 trend
- **Greys:** Muted Grey (#8B8680), Charcoal (#36342F) for backgrounds
- **Accents:** Burnt Orange (#8B4513), Dusty Rose (#A67D7C) for CTAs

**Application**
- Dark muted palettes as backgrounds (charcoal, deep grey) to showcase products
- Earthy accent colors for typography & UI elements
- Minimal color contrast (avoid high-saturation brights)
- White/cream for breathing room & content hierarchy

**Trend Note:** 2025 favors organic, imperfect textures paired with muted, desaturated tones reflecting sustainability & handcrafted authenticity.

## 4. Typography Choices for Craftsmanship

**Recommended Type Pairing**

| Use Case | Font Style | 2024-25 Trend |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Headings | Serif (Display) | Renaissance-inspired (Heldane, Bookmania) or custom script |
| Body Text | Serif (Text weight) or Readable Sans | High legibility, classic feel |
| Accent/Logo | Handwritten script or Custom calligraphy | Organic, artisan aesthetic |

**Specific Recommendations**
- **Display Serif:** Heldane (contemporary renaissance), Bookmania (retro-literary), Garamond (timeless)
- **Body Copy:** Georgia, Droid Serif, or Crimson Text (readable, refined)
- **Artisan Touch:** Custom handwritten script for headers, artist signature on logo
- **2024 Trend:** Mix italic + bold serif weights for off-kilter elegance; avoid perfection-polished looks

**Application Strategy**
- Mix serif (headings) + sans-serif (body) for visual hierarchy
- Script fonts sparingly—logo, section headers, hero tagline only
- Font size: Large, generous leading (1.6-1.8) for luxury feel
- Weight variation: Bold headers (600-700) vs. regular body (400)

## 5. Photo Gallery & Showroom Presentation Styles

**Gallery Layout Options**
1. **Grid Gallery:** Consistent-sized thumbnails (3-4 columns on desktop) → lightbox on click
2. **Masonry Grid:** Variable-height images for visual interest while maintaining flow
3. **Horizontal Scroll:** Showcase related pieces (e.g., bowl collection, vase series)
4. **Featured Hero + Grid:** Large featured product with supporting thumbnail grid

**Lightbox Implementation**
- Modal overlay with soft fade-in animation
- Image captions with product specs, price, material
- Prev/Next navigation for browsing without closing
- Mobile-optimized touch gestures (swipe)
- Options: Fancybox, Lightgallery, Prettyphoto (WordPress plugins)

**Showroom Aesthetic**
- White or off-white negative space around images
- Subtle shadows or depth cues (1-3px soft shadows)
- Raw/natural product photography (avoid heavy editing)
- Consistent background (seamless white/cream backdrop for all products)
- Context lifestyle shots (product on shelf, in room setting)

**Mobile Optimization**
